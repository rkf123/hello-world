# hello-world
I'm in the financial services industry and work with partners and business owners, mostly in the area of business financing.
# In addition to learning GitHub, I am taking a Python/Financial Analysis class, as my goal is to build a stock option trading program to simulate
# what I've been playing around with as a hobby for years
